The Hypothesis API
==================

This document details the ``h`` application's public HTTP API. It is targeted at
developers interested in integrating functionality from Hypothesis into their
own applications.


Authorization
-------------

Some of the API URLs documented below require a valid API token.
To use these API URLs you should:

1. Generate yourself an API token on your
   `Hypothesis developer page <https://hypothes.is/profile/developer>`_
   (you must be signed in to Hypothesis to get to this page).

2. Put the API token in the ``Authorization`` header in your requests to the
   API.

**Example request**::

   GET /api
   Host: hypothes.is
   Accept: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer 6879-31d62c13b0099456de5379de90f90395

(Replace ``6879-31d62c13b0099456de5379de90f90395`` with your own API token.)


root
----

.. http:get:: /api

   API root. Returns hypermedia links to the rest of the API.

   **Example request**::

      GET /api
      Host: hypothes.is
      Accept: application/json


   **Example response**::

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

   :reqheader Accept: desired response content type
   :resheader Content-Type: response content type
   :statuscode 200: no error


search
------

.. http:get:: /api/search

   Search for annotations.

   **Example request**::

      GET /api/search?limit=1000&user=gluejar@hypothes.is
      Host: hypothes.is
      Accept: application/json

   **Example response**::

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

      {
          "rows": [
              {
                  "consumer": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                  "created": "2014-01-12T18:36:15.697572+00:00",
                  "id": "LGVKq4E4SKKro1dBBEMwsA",
                  "permissions": { ... },
                  "references": ["6lkzoOubSOOymDNDIgazqw"],
                  "target": [],
                  "text": "Peut-etre",
                  "updated": "2014-01-12T18:36:15.697588+00:00",
                  "uri": "http://epubjs-reader.appspot.com//moby-dick/OPS/chapter_003.xhtml",
                  "user": "acct:gluejar@hypothes.is"
              }
          ],
          "total": 1
      }

   :query limit: The maximum number of annotations to return, for example:
       ``/api/search?limit=30``. (Default: 20)

   :query offset: The minimum number of initial annotations to skip. This is
       used for pagination. For example if there are 65 annotations matching
       our search query and we're retrieving up to 30 annotations at a time,
       then to retrieve the last 5 do: ``/api/search?limit=30&offset=60``.
       (Default: 0)
       

   :query sort: Specify which field the annotations should be sorted by. For
       example to sort annotations by the name of the user that created them,
       do: ``/api/search?sort=user`` (default: updated)

   :query order: Specify which order (ascending or descending) the annotations
       should be sorted in. For example to sort annotations in ascending
       order of created time (i.e. oldest annotations first) do:
       ``/api/search?sort=created&order=asc``. (Default: desc)

   :query uri: Search for annotations of a particular URI, for example
       ``/api/search?uri=www.example.com``. URI searches will also find
       annotations of *equivalent* URIs. For example if the HTML document at
       ``http://www.example.com/document.html`` includes a
       ``<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/canonical_document.html">``
       then annotations of ``http://www.example.com/canonical_document.html``
       will also be included in the search results. Other forms of document
       equivalence that are supported include rel="alternate" links, DOIs,
       PDF file IDs, and more.

   :query user: Search for annotations by a particular user. For example
       ``/api/search?user=tim``  will find all annotations by users named
       ``tim`` at any provider, ``/api/search?user=tim@hypothes.is`` will only
       find annotations by ``tim@hypothes.is``.

   :query text: Search for annotations whose body text contains some text,
       for example: ``/api/search?text=foobar``
       
   :query group: You can filter annotations also by the groups in which they are posted by using the parameter ``/api/search?group=GROUPID``

   :query any: Search for annotations whose ``quote``, ``tags``, ``text``,
       ``uri.parts`` or ``user`` fields match some query text.
       For example: ``/api/search?any=foobar``.

   .. todo:: Document the ``document`` query parameter.

      This parameter is treated specially. We're holding off documenting it for
      now because upcoming work on document equivalence is likely to change it.
      
      

   You can also search for any other field that you see in annotations returned
   by the h API. Visit ``/api/search`` with no parameters to see some
   annotations and their fields. For example to search for all annotations
   with the tag "climatefeedback" do::

       /api/search?tags=climatefeedback

   ``tag`` also works the same as tags.

   To search for all annotations that user ``seanh@hypothes.is`` has
   permission to delete do::

       /api/search?permissions.delete=acct:seanh@hypothes.is

   You can give any query parameter multiple times. For example
   ``/api/search?tags=climate&tags=feedback`` will find all annotations that
   have *either* tag "climate" *or* "feedback".

   .. warning:: The ``id`` field isn't usable in searches.

      Searching for an individual annotation by ID::

          /api/search?id=AVAqBdTCiSJM1mYBTinl

      won't return any results. To retrieve a single annotation by ID use
      the :ref:`read API <read API>` instead.

   :reqheader Accept: desired response content type
   :resheader Content-Type: response content type
   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 400: errors parsing your query
